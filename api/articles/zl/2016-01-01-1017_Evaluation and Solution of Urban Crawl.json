This task is more important than ever because the world is rapidly urbanizing. It is projected that by 2050, 66 percent of the world’s population will be urban—this will result in a projected 2.5 billion people being added to the urban population.[3] Consequently, urban planning has become increasingly important and necessary to ensure that people have access to equitable and sustainable homes, resources and jobs.<br/>Smart growth is an urban planning theory that originated in 1990’s as a means to curb continued urban sprawl and reduce the loss of farmland surrounding urban centers. The ten principles for smart growth are<br/>1 Mix land uses<br/>2 Take advantage of compact building design<br/>3 Create a range of housing opportunities and choices<br/>4 Create walkable neighborhoods<br/>5 Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place<br/>6 Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas<br/>7 Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities<br/>8 Provide a variety of transportation choices<br/>9 Make development decisions predictable, fair, and cost effective<br/>10 Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions<br/>These broad principles must be tailored to a community’s unique needs to be effective.  Thus, any measure of success must incorporate the demographics, growth needs, and geographical conditions of a city as well as the goal to adhere to the three E’s.</p>\n<p>以下是我们小组的文章：</p>\n<h2 id=\"Evaluation-and-Solution-of-Urban-Crawl\"><a href=\"#Evaluation-and-Solution-of-Urban-Crawl\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Evaluation and Solution of Urban Crawl\"></a>Evaluation and Solution of Urban Crawl</h2><h3 id=\"Abstract\"><a href=\"#Abstract\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Abstract\"></a>Abstract</h3><p>In this paper, based on theproblems, we divide our thinking into 4 parts.</p>\n<p>For task 1, we developa ’Successful Smart Growth’ index (SSG) to measure the governance of urbancrawl based on the impact of the ten principles on the three E’s and happiness.We used the rank correlation analysis and geometric compare scale to considerhow the factors were affected by each principle. Using this as a basis, wedetermine the influence level and furthermore the weights of the three E’s andhappiness in the SSG index. Finally we calculated the weighted sum of thenondimensionalized variance of three E’s and happiness and used that tocalculate our SSG index.</p>\n<p>For task 2, we appliedour model to two cities: TAKASAKI and Mobile City. Based on our assumptions, weuse the financial condition of the annual statement and the variance ratio atthe national level to represent the changes in three E’s and happiness. Afterthat, we nondimensionalized the variance of three E’s and happiness by usingthe algebraic model to calculate the variance ratio. Finally, we gave score ofthe SSG index of TAKASAKI and Mobile City.</p>\n<p>For task 3 &amp; 4, weproposed six individual initiatives and developed a more robust model — FSGPindex based on the situation of TAKASAKI and Mobile City. According to theproblems in the cities, we proposed our smart growth plan based on tenprinciples. Using the scale comparison method and the weighting method, weobtained the SPG index. Then with the enlightenment of <em>the theory of optimum population ( A. Sauvy ) </em>, we calculated theproper population density for development by using the quadratic function andsymbolic-graphic combination. Finally, we used profit loss equation to defineprofit loss coefficient and optimized the SSG index by using the coefficient.</p>\n<p>For task 5, using theconcept of task 4, we divided the result of population increase into twoconditions. And we analyzed the changes of our initiatives in two conditionsand prove the robustness of our model.</p>\n<p>Synthesize tenprinciples, three E’s and happiness, we evaluated the success of smart growthof cities and their plans.</p>\n<p>​                <strong>Key Words: </strong>SSG index          SmartGrowth         FSGP index</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-Introduction\"><a href=\"#1-Introduction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1         Introduction\"></a>1         Introduction</h3><h4 id=\"1-1-Background\"><a href=\"#1-1-Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.1       Background\"></a>1.1       Background</h4><p>Urban development had come up to aseries of problems since 1970s. The boundary of the city was getting blurry. The original city planning could not adapt the change since more people werepurchasing houses in the suburban area. These phenomenon caused thedegeneration of natural resources, the loss in the open space, the aggravationof traffic, the large-scale expenditure of infrastructure. Scholars pointed outthat a large scale crash down would be inevitable if the city keep consumingresources in an unsustainable way.</p>\n<p>Organizationslike the Environmental Protection Agency offer solutions in many aspects forthose problems, and finally concluded them into a concept with ten principlescalled ’smart growth’. After this strategy was published, according to a survey[1] carried by Smart Growth Network in Oct. 2000, 78% of the US citizenssupported that it is a necessity to curb the urban crawl.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-2-Restatement\"><a href=\"#1-2-Restatement\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.2       Restatement\"></a>1.2       Restatement</h4><p>If we evaluate the progress of thesmart growth, the changes of the ten principles could be indistinct, but thegoal of the whole activity is clear, that is make the city a more economicallyprosperous, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable. When weinterpret the goal of smart growth, we believe the happiness(in the aspect ofcountry is GNH) would also be affected by the principles. According to theGeller(2003) [2], smart growth could curb the damage of the environment,improve the accessibility of infrastructure, promote the healthy life style andbuild a livable city so that the overall living quality can be improved. Thus,based on ten principles, we interpret:</p>\n<p>•   Economically prosperous</p>\n<p>•   Equitable society</p>\n<p>•   Environmentally sustainable</p>\n<p>•   Happiness of citizens as ourreference objects to evaluate the success of the smart growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-Task-1-Model-for-Smart-Growth-Measurement\"><a href=\"#2-Task-1-Model-for-Smart-Growth-Measurement\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2         Task 1: Model for Smart Growth Measurement\"></a>2         Task 1: Model for Smart Growth Measurement</h3><h4 id=\"2-1-Outline-of-Our-Approach\"><a href=\"#2-1-Outline-of-Our-Approach\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.1       Outline of Our Approach\"></a>2.1       Outline of Our Approach</h4><p>We came to an approach to measurethe success of smart growth by treating the reference objects as the factors inthe process of smart growth:</p>\n<p>•    Economy</p>\n<p>•    Equity</p>\n<p>•    Environment</p>\n<p>•    Happiness</p>\n<p>By analyzing theobjects in order relation, we developed an index named: Successful Smart Growthindex (SSG)(<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/f1.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/></center>\n<center>Figure 1: <em>Framework of SSGindex</em></center>\n<p>The ten principles are shown in <em>Table 1</em> with corresponding codes from <em>P1</em> to <em>P10</em>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Code</th>\n<th>Principles</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>P1</td>\n<td>Mix land  uses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P2</td>\n<td>Take  advantage of compact building design</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P3</td>\n<td>Create a  range of housing opportunities and choices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P4</td>\n<td>Create  walkable neighborhoods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P5</td>\n<td>Foster  distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P6</td>\n<td>Preserve  open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P7</td>\n<td>Strengthen  and direct development towards existing communities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P8</td>\n<td>Provide  a variety of transportation choices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P9</td>\n<td>Make  development decisions predictable, fair, and cost effective</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P10</td>\n<td>Encourage community and  stakeholder collaboration in development decisions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Table 1: <em>Codes of tenprinciples</em></p>\n<p>Originatingfrom the problem of urban crawl, based on ten principles, different methods wasoffered to solve it. But if we want to evaluate the progress of the smartgrowth of a city, it is required to analyze the factors which could be affectedby the principles, that is our reference objects. Thus we interpret theprinciples as the influencing factors of the three E0s and happiness.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-2-Modeling-of-SSG-index\"><a href=\"#2-2-Modeling-of-SSG-index\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.2       Modeling of SSG index\"></a>2.2       Modeling of SSG index</h4><h5 id=\"2-2-1-Model-assumptions\"><a href=\"#2-2-1-Model-assumptions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.2.1      Model assumptions\"></a>2.2.1      Model assumptions</h5><p>There are a myraid of factors thatcould affect the process of smart growth, it is impossible to consider all ofthem, thus we list out the following assumptions as restrictions of the model:</p>\n<p>•    We would only consider theactions based on the ten principles, all the occasionality outside thedefinition of the principles would be ignored.</p>\n<p>•    As for a developed country, weassume the gap of GNH, EPI, social equity index between its cities and thecountry itself can be ignored. Thus we could use the data of the country torepresent the situation in a specific city.</p>\n<p>•    We consider the total effect ofeach principle to the three E0s and happiness is the same.</p>\n<p>•    We assume none of the varianceratio of three E0s and happiness would be zero.</p>\n<p>•    We ignore the interactionsamong ten principles as well as the three E0s and happiness.</p>\n<h5 id=\"2-2-2-Parameter-setting\"><a href=\"#2-2-2-Parameter-setting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.2.2       Parameter setting\"></a>2.2.2       Parameter setting</h5><center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/t2.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/></center>\n<center>Table 2: <em>parameter setting</em></center>\n<h5 id=\"2-2-3-The-solution-to-the-model\"><a href=\"#2-2-3-The-solution-to-the-model\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.2.3      The solution to the model\"></a>2.2.3      The solution to the model</h5><p>Since different principles mayresult in different effects on the three E0s and happiness, we set weights tomeasure the progress of smart growth and create a fomula of SSG index.</p>\n <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/g1.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/>(1)</center>                                                                          \n<p>In this formula, the success of the smart growth of the city is evaluated by thevariance ratio of three E0s (∆<em>E</em>1 to∆<em>E</em>3) and happiness (in the fomula means ∆<em>E</em>4), along with different weights caused by the ten principles.Different principle plays a different role in the impact to the three E0s and happiness.[3] For example, as for mix land uses, it would mainly improve the availabilityof the land which may bring positive economic results. Thus, the economicfactor values most. Besides, the multi-used land could improve the livingconvenient level, which is the main factor of happiness. After that, thedecrese of living radius could improve the environment situation which givesthe environment the third place while this action may only present indirecteffect on social equity.</p>\n<p>Now we have theranking to the effect on the three E0s and happiness. In the above example,the ranking order is economy, happiness, environment, equity. In order toemphasize the principal effect, we used a geometric progession (set thevariable <em>r</em> be the ranking of theimpact):</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/g2.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/>(2)</center>                                                                                 \n<p>The rest nine principles would beanalyzed with the same method as above. <em>Uji </em>is the element</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/f2.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/></center><br/><center>Figure 2: <em>the contributionrate of ten principles</em></center>\n<p>in the j-th row and i-th column of <em>Figure 2</em>. Since each principle posesrelatively different effects on the three E0s and happiness, we have already gotthe rank of the priority in <em>Figure 2</em>.In the assumption we consider the the total effect of each principle on thethree E0s and happiness is the same. Thus we define the weight of the smartgrowth <em>Wi</em> is:</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/g3.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/>(3)</center>                                                                 \n<p>After the calculation, we obtain theweight (<em>Wi</em>) of the three E0s and happiness in <em>Figure 3</em>:</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonggwan/Photo_backup/master/icm/f3.jpg\" alt=\"img\"/></center>\n<center>Figure 3: <em>the weight of SSGindex</em></center>\n<p>Since the SSG index was created to measure the success of the smart growth of a city, thus, after outputing the result of the index, some analysis could be used:</p>\n<p>•<strong>SSG</strong> &gt; <strong>0</strong> The smart growth of the city is very likely to be a success.</p>\n<p>•<strong>SSG</strong> &lt;  <strong>0</strong> The city doesnot matches the principles of smart growth.</p>\n<p>•<strong>SSG</strong> = <strong>0</strong> The plan of the city attended to one thing and lost sight of another.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-3-Evaluation-of-the-Model\"><a href=\"#2-3-Evaluation-of-the-Model\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.3       Evaluation of the Model\"></a>2.3       Evaluation of the Model</h4><p>To assess whether a model cansolve a problem or not, we need to figure out the comprehensiveness. In orderto assess the success of the smart growth, we consulted 4 indexes:</p>\n<p>• <strong>GDP </strong>(GrossDomestic Product)</p>\n<p>• <strong>Gini Coefficient</strong></p>\n<p>• <strong>EPI </strong>(EnvironmentPerformance Index)</p>\n<p>• <strong>GNH </strong>(Gross National Happiness)</p>\n<p>Referring tothe contribution rate in <em>Figure 2</em>, weobtain the significance ordering of the indexes and give out a weighted sum. Asfor the success of smart growth, we interpret it as the combined effect of our4 reference objects: Economy, Equity, Environment, Happiness. Thus, the SSGindex includes all the aspects of smart growth.</p>\n<h5 id=\"2-3-1-Strengths\"><a href=\"#2-3-1-Strengths\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.3.1      Strengths\"></a>2.3.1      Strengths</h5><p>•    Consider the aspects of tenprinciples can not be covered by three E0s, we chose happiness as the forthparameter to evaluate the success of smart growth.</p>\n<p>•    During the process of settingthe index, we determine the contribution rate of ten principles as thereference of deciding the weights of three E0s and happiness. The complexity of theproblem was simplified because of the decrease of dimension.</p>\n<p>•    When we decide the weight ofthree E0s and happiness by analyzing the contribution rate of tenprinciples, the use of order relations can represent different influence madeby different principle; the geometric compare scale shows our good handling onprimary effect and secondary effect.</p>\n<h5 id=\"2-3-2-Weeknesses\"><a href=\"#2-3-2-Weeknesses\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.3.2      Weeknesses\"></a>2.3.2      Weeknesses</h5><p>•    The comparison scale of themodel to set the weight is relatively subjective.</p>\n<p>•    The number of variable factorsin the model is not enough and the model is rather simple.</p>\n<p>Thus, this model may be affectedby other factors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-Task-2-Case-Study\"><a href=\"#3-Task-2-Case-Study\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3         Task 2: Case Study\"></a>3         Task 2: Case Study</h3><h4 id=\"3-1-The-smart-growth-plan-of-TAKASAKI-City-Japan\"><a href=\"#3-1-The-smart-growth-plan-of-TAKASAKI-City-Japan\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3.1       The smart growth plan of TAKASAKI City, Japan\"></a>3.1       The smart growth plan of TAKASAKI City, Japan</h4><p>From the annual report of TAKASAKICity[4] , we analyzed the actions that could pose positive effects based on thesmart growth principles. And three E0s and happiness are the referenceobjects of the principles. Thus, the <em>Figure4 </em>focuses on the actions related to the reference objects.</p>\n<p>Firstly, as for the reforming of land distribution, it matches <strong>P1</strong>. This action would create a multi-function community and theutility of land. The government of TAKASAKI strengthen a lot of infrastructureand the quality of roads which would greatly improve the convenience of thecitizens and redistribute the social resources, which matches <strong>P7 </strong>, <strong>P4 </strong>and <strong>P8</strong>. In orderto make the environmental situation better, more budgets were invested tolandscape planning and afforestation. Both of them can be treated as the partof sustainable development and they match <strong>P6 </strong>and <strong>P5</strong>. The maintenance of parking lots and the restriction on the outdooradvertisements could give the citizens a more pleasant home.

The population density of the city which does not locate in the intervalwould be treated as inapporopriate in development.</p>\n<p>Futhermore,we introduced the limitation factor of population A. With a certain populationwhich is suitable for city development, a slightly increase in the populationdensity would bring relatively great GNP effect. When the population densityalmost approaches the optimized population density, a large scale of populationdensity increase would only bring slight effect to GNP.</p>\n<p>This curve ofthe function of population density and GNP is convex, which proves thecorrectness of the fitting figure.</p>\n<p>Since under theinfluence of population factor, the initiative of the plan on the economiclevel could not reach the ideal result. Thus, we defined the limitation factorA as the real number in the interval of [0, 1].
