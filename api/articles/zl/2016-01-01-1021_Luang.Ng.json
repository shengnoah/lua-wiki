Both of\nthese features are disabled by default and can be enabled via _config.yml. You\ncan also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html).\nThe beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean... Jekyll Clean!</p>\n<p>The theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the\nsidebar. The links pane in the sidebar is available on mobile through the nav menu,\nand you can do the same thing for any other sections added to the sidebar.</p>\n<p>Don&#39;t forget to occassionally merge against my upstream repository so you can get\nthe latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!</p>\n<p>If you don&#39;t have a blog already on github, start by cloning this repository.\nBest to do that directly on github and then clone that down to your computer.</p>\n<p>If you already do have a blog, You can certainly apply this theme to your existing\nblog in place, but then you won&#39;t be able to merge as the theme changes. If you\nre-apply your blog history on top of this theme&#39;s <strong>gh-pages</strong> branch, it&#39;s then\neasy to update to the latest version of the theme. You also don&#39;t want to have to\ndeal with resolving old conflicts from your existing history, so you may wish to to\npush your existing master off to a new branch so you have the old history and start\na new branch with this as the start, merging in your _posts and other assets (after\ngit rm&#39;ing the current _posts.</p>\n<p>Not ideal, but you have to make a choice - either apply it manually or base your\nblog off this theme&#39;s branch. Either way it will work, and both have their own\npros and cons.</p>\n<p>You can setup an upstream tracking repository like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:scotte/jekyll-clean.git\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And now when you wish to merge your own branch onto the latest version of the\ntheme, simply do:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">$ git fetch upstream\n$ git merge upstream/gh-pages\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Of course you will have to resolve conflicts for _config.yml, _includes/links-list.html,\nand _posts, and so on, but in practice this is pretty simple.</p>\n<p>This is how I maintain my own blog which is based on this theme. The old history is\nsitting in an <strong>old-master</strong> branch that I can refer to when I need to.</p>\n<h1 id=\"license\">License</h1>\n<p>The content of this theme is distributed and licensed under a\n<img src=\"https://luangng.github.io//images/cc_by_88x31.png\" alt=\"License Badge\"/>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License</a></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work,\neven commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.
